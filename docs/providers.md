### How to choose a provider

If you're not sure which provider to start with, we **recommend [OpenAI](#openai)** as it's the most popular and has the **widest range of capabilities**: [💬 text-generation](./features.md#-text-generation), [🖌️ image-generation](./features.md#️-image-generation), [🦻 speech-to-text](./features.md#-speech-to-text), [🗣️ text-to-speech](./features.md#️-text-to-speech).

You don't need to choose just one though. The bot supports [mixing & matching models](./features.md#-mixing--matching-models), so you can use multiple providers at the same time.


### How to use a provider

- sign up for it
- obtain an API key
- [create a new agent](./agents.md#creating-agents)
- set it as a handler for some types of messages (see [Mixing & matching models](./features.md#-mixing--matching-models)) for a specific room or globally
